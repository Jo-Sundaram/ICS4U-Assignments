# ICS4U-Assignments
Contains all of my Java work and assignments from my ICS4U class.

In this class I learned the basics of the Java language and familiarized myself with it throughout the course. Some of the things I learned in the course are different sort and search algorithms, reading and writing to files and creating a GUI.

The IDE's I used were Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea
